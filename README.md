# UnityMazeSolver - Intelligent Maze Navigation using Flood Fill Algorithm

Welcome to UnityMazeSolver, an interactive maze-solving project developed using Unity and powered by the efficient Flood Fill algorithm written in C#. This project showcases the synergy between game development and intelligent pathfinding, offering a dynamic visual representation of maze navigation.

## Key Features

- **Flood Fill Algorithm:** UnityMazeSolver employs the Flood Fill algorithm to navigate through maze structures. This simple yet powerful algorithm intelligently explores the maze, finding the shortest path from the start to the end point.

- **Unity Integration:** Leveraging the Unity game engine, this project provides a tangible and immersive experience. Witness the algorithm in action as it interacts with maze environments, demonstrating the algorithm's capabilities in a visual manner.

- **Real-time Visualization:** Gain insights into the flood fill process with real-time visualization. Watch as the algorithm systematically labels cells with their respective distances from the starting point, effectively mapping the optimal path.

- **Custom Mazes:** Test UnityMazeSolver's versatility by supplying custom maze designs. Whether it's a classic labyrinth or a creatively crafted maze, the Flood Fill algorithm adapts seamlessly to solve it.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to simplify interaction. Load your maze within Unity, select the Flood Fill algorithm, and observe the maze-solving process with ease.

## How to Use
